Always Declare Document Type
Always declare the document type as the first line in your document.

The correct document type for HTML is:

<!DOCTYPE html>
Use Lowercase Element Names
HTML allows mixing uppercase and lowercase letters in element names.

However, we recommend using lowercase element names, because:

Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad
Developers normally use lowercase names
Lowercase looks cleaner
Lowercase is easier to write
Good:
<body>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
Bad:
<BODY>
<P>This is a paragraph.</P>
</BODY>

Close All HTML Elements
In HTML, you do not have to close all elements (for example the <p> element).

However, we strongly recommend closing all HTML elements, like this:

Good:
<section>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</section>
Bad:
<section>
  <p>This is a paragraph.
  <p>This is a paragraph.
</section>
Use Lowercase Attribute Names
HTML allows mixing uppercase and lowercase letters in attribute names.

However, we recommend using lowercase attribute names, because:

Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad
Developers normally use lowercase names
Lowercase looks cleaner
Lowercase is easier to write
Good:
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a>
Bad:
<a HREF="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a>
Always Quote Attribute Values
HTML allows attribute values without quotes.

However, we recommend quoting attribute values, because:

Developers normally quote attribute values
Quoted values are easier to read
You MUST use quotes if the value contains spaces
Good:
<table class="striped">
Bad:
<table class=striped>
Very bad:
This will not work, because the value contains spaces:

<table class=table striped>
Always Specify alt, width, and height for Images
Always specify the alt attribute for images. This attribute is important if the image for some reason cannot be displayed.

Also, always define the width and height of images. This reduces flickering, because the browser can reserve space for the image before loading.

Good:
<img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5" style="width:128px;height:128px">
Bad:
<img src="html5.gif">
Spaces and Equal Signs
HTML allows spaces around equal signs. But space-less is easier to read and groups entities better together.

Good:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
Bad:
<link rel = "stylesheet" href = "styles.css">
Avoid Long Code Lines
When using an HTML editor, it is NOT convenient to scroll right and left to read the HTML code.

Try to avoid too long code lines.

Blank Lines and Indentation
Do not add blank lines, spaces, or indentations without a reason.

For readability, add blank lines to separate large or logical code blocks.

For readability, add two spaces of indentation. Do not use the tab key.

Good:
<body>

<h1>Famous Cities</h1>

<h2>Tokyo</h2>
<p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan, the center of the Greater Tokyo Area, and the most populous metropolitan area in the world.</p>

<h2>London</h2>
<p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom.</p>

<h2>Paris</h2>
<p>Paris is the capital of France. The Paris area is one of the largest population centers in Europe.</p>

</body>
Bad:

Good Table Example:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>Description of A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>Description of B</td>
  </tr>
</table>
Good List Example:
<ul>
  <li>London</li>
  <li>Paris</li>
  <li>Tokyo</li>
</ul>
Never Skip the <title> Element
The <title> element is required in HTML.

The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

The <title> element:

defines a title in the browser toolbar
provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
displays a title for the page in search-engine results
So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible: 

<title>HTML Style Guide and Coding Conventions</title>
Omitting <html> and <body>?
An HTML page will validate without the <html> and <body> tags:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
