The <div> Element
The <div> element is by default a block element, meaning that it takes all available width, and comes with line breaks before and after.

Example
A <div> element takes up all available width:

Lorem Ipsum <div>I am a div</div> dolor sit amet.
Result
Lorem Ipsum
I am a div
dolor sit amet.
